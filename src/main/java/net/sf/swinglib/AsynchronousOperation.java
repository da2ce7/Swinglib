/**
 *  A base class for implementing operations that need to run on their own
 *  thread and report back to the event thread. Unlike Sun's <code>SwingWorker
 *  </code> class, this object does not spawn its own thread. Instead, it must
 *  be passed to a program-created thread, or better, a threadpool.
 *  <p>
 *  To use, subclass and pass an instance to your operation thread.
 *  <p>
 *  You must implement at least the {@link #performOperation} method, which is
 *  executed on the operation thread. This method may return a single object,
 *  or throw any exception type. Depending on how it completes (return/throw),
 *  one of {@link #onSuccess}, {@link #onFailure} will then be executed on the
 *  event thread.
