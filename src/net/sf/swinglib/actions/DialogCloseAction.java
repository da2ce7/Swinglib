 *  a controller class that wraps that dialog's fields. Such dialogs do not
 *  need to take specific actions in response to the "OK" or "Cancel"
 *  button, because the controller handles that.
 *  <p>
 *  When to dispose versus hide: dispose dialogs that are infrequently used;
 *  this will free system resources. However, when you dispose a dialog you
 *  need to <code>pack()</code> it before displaying it again.
